# Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) C++ Transpiler

The FHE C++ Transpiler is an open-sourced technology that will allow any
C++ developer to perform transformations on encrypted data without decrypting
it.

This transpiler connects Google’s [XLS library](https://google.github.io/xls/)
to the [TFHE library](https://tfhe.github.io/tfhe/). It will allow developers
(including those without expertise in cryptography) to write code that runs on
encrypted data, without revealing the data contents or the computations’ result.
This library should help lay the groundwork for further advancements on
practical FHE systems.

This library is currently only supported on Linux, and requires GCC version 9
(or later) and
[Bazel 4.0.0](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-overview.html).

This is currently an exploratory proof-of-concept. While it could be deployed in
practice, the run-times of the FHE-C++ operations are likely to be too long to
be practical at this time. This transpiler heavily relies on the TFHE library
for security guarantees. Since TFHE is relatively new, there are yet to be
robust cryptanalyses of TFHE. Thus, before including this library in a live
production deployment, be aware that there may be yet undiscovered
vulnerabilities in TFHE.

## Quick start

This section describes how to install and run the FHE C++ Transpiler. If you
have any problems, please see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section
near the bottom of this document.

### Install the FHE C++ Transpiler

This repository offers two ways to install the FHE C++ Transpiler.

#### Option A: Install the transpiler on your Linux machine

In order to install the FHE C++ Transpiler on your Linux machine:

1.  Install Bazel version 4.0.0, if you don't have it already. Bazel 4.0.0 can
    be [installed directly](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html)
    or Bazel versions can be managed through
    [Bazelisk](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-bazelisk.html).

2.  Install the following additional required packages using your Linux
    distribution's package manager:

    * `gcc` in version 9 or higher.
    * `git`, which is required for downloading some dependencies using
    Bazel.
    * `libtinfo5` or `ncurses5-compat-libs`
    * `python2`
    * `python3`
    * `python3-pip`

    You can install all of the above by running the following commands,
    depending on you distribution.

    * On Debian-based distributions:

      ```shell
      sudo apt install gcc git libtinfo5 python python3 python3-pip
      ```

    * On Arch-based distributions with [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org) enabled:

      ```shell
      sudo pacman -Syu gcc git ncurses5-compat-libs python2 python python-pip
      ```

3.  Download [the latest version of this
    repository](https://github.com/google/fully-homomorphic-encryption/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
    and extract it. Alternatively, you can use `git` to clone the repository on
    your local machine using the following command:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/google/fully-homomorphic-encryption.git`
    ```

#### Option B: Use Docker to install the transpiler

1.  [Install Docker for your platform](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2.  Download [the latest version of this
    repository](https://github.com/google/fully-homomorphic-encryption/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
    and extract it.  Navigate to the extracted folder.  Alternatively, you can
    also use `git` to clone the repository using the following command:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/google/fully-homomorphic-encryption.git`
    ```

3.  Navigate to the root of this repository, which contains the `Dockerfile`
    and run

    ```shell
    docker build -t google-fhe-transpiler .
    ```
    This may take around 1 hour, depending on your system configuration.

4.  Execute `docker run --rm -i -t google-fhe-transpiler bash` to connect to
    a fresh instance that has the transpiler installed. You have to run
    `bazelisk` (which is automatically installed by the `Dockerfile`),
    rather than `bazel`, to build and run the examples in the following
    steps.

### Running the FHE C++ Transpiler

To run the FHE C++ Transpiler, go to the `fully-homomorphic-encryption/`
directory that contains the FHE C++ Transpiler code, and run the following
command to start the `hangman` demo:

```shell
bazel run //transpiler/examples/hangman:hangman_client
```

This will automatically build the core FHE C++ Transpiler library, which may
take a long time (i.e., over an hour) when building the first time. Once the
demo is running, a game of
[Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) will be playable,
illustrating that the player's letter guesses and game progress are is unknown
to the server.

### Transpiling your code

To run the FHE C++ Transpiler on your own C++ code, follow these steps:

1.  Create a subdirectory in `fully-homomorphic-encryption/transpiler/examples/`
    (e.g., `fn`).
2.  Add the C++ file that contains the code to be transpiled into the
    aforementioned subdirectory.
3.  Create a testbench (e.g., `fn_tfhe_testbench`) and `BUILD` file
    similar to those in the library’s examples, but that uses your FHE-C++ instead.
4.  Run the transpiler with the following command, replacing `fn` with the
    name of your subdirectory and testbench file names, followed by two dashes, and
    any needed additional arguments (e.g., `"arg1"`, `"arg2"`):

```shell
bazel run //transpiler/examples/fn:fn_tfhe_testbench -- "arg1" "arg2"
```

A more comprehensive guide on building your own demo can be found at
[docs/build_your_own_demo.md](./docs/build_your_own_demo.md).

## Demos

This section lists the demos included in this library that are intended to be
simple, yet effective, examples of possible uses for the FHE C++ Transpiler.

There are also `bazel` commands to compile and run each demo. For demos with a
choice of two commands, the first "baseline" command generates FHE-C++ that uses
only a single processor core (i.e., slow), while the second "interpreter"
command generates FHE-C++ that utilizes multiple cores (i.e., significantly
faster). Both commands assume your working directory is within the workspace
`fully-homomorphic-encryption/`.

**Note:** All demos are for illustrative purposes only, and are not designed for
live production deployments. For example, the demos' encryption keys all use a
hard coded simple seed, which is not secure in a production service. Live
production deployments should use cryptographically secure seeds that are
securely stored, as well as implement all appropriate design, security, privacy,
and other best practices.

### Calculator

The Calculator demo adds, subtracts, or multiples two encrypted short integers,
without the server knowing the integers or the result.

*  Baseline FHE-C++ translation command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/calculator:calculator_tfhe_testbench
   ```
*  Multi-core interpreter command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/calculator:calculator_interpreted_tfhe_testbench
   ```

### Fibonacci

The Fibonacci demo calculates the sum of the Fibonacci sequence up to the
n<sup>th</sup> integer in the sequence.

*  Baseline FHE-C++ translation command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/fibonacci:fibonacci_tfhe_testbench
   ```
*  Multi-core interpreter command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/fibonacci:fibonacci_interpreted_tfhe_testbench
   ```

### Hangman

The Hangman demo is a classical game of Hangman, but with privacy. The server
does not know which letters the player is choosing or whether they won or lost.

```shell
bazel run //transpiler/examples/hangman:hangman_client
```

![Hangman screenshot](./images/screenshot_hangman.png)

### Private information retrieval

This demo highlights single-server private information retrieval (PIR). User-
provided characters are retrieved by index without the server knowing the query
or the data it's storing. This is an O(N) operation, where N is the number of
records in the database.

*  Baseline FHE-C++ translation command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/pir:pir_client
   ```
*  Multi-core interpreter command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/pir:pir_interpreted_client
   ```

### Reverse string

This demo reverses an encrypted string without the server knowing the string.

*  Baseline FHE-C++ translation command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/string_reverse:string_reverse_tfhe_testbench "hello"
   ```
*  Multi-core interpreter command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/string_reverse:string_reverse_interpreted_tfhe_testbench "hello"
   ```

### Simple sum

This demo adds two encrypted integers without the server knowing either integer
or the resulting sum.

*  Baseline FHE-C++ translation command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/simple_sum:simple_sum_tfhe_testbench
   ```
*  Multi-core interpreter command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/simple_sum:simple_sum_interpreted_tfhe_testbench
   ```

### String capitalization

In this demo, each word in an encrypted sentence can be capitalized without the
server knowing the sentence.

There are two versions of this demo:

1.  In the `string_cap` example, the FHE-C++ code inputs the entire
    encrypted string and internally iterates over each character.

    *  Baseline FHE-C++ translation command:
    ```shell
    bazel run //transpiler/examples/string_cap:string_cap_tfhe_testbench "do or do not; there is no try"
    ```
    *  Multi-core interpreter command:
    ```shell
    bazel run //transpiler/examples/string_cap:string_cap_interpreted_tfhe_testbench "do or do not; there is no try"
    ```

2.  In the `string_cap_char` example, the FHE-C++ code operates on one
    character at a time. This example can provide more output regarding the
    string transformation process, for illustrative purposes.

    *  Baseline FHE-C++ translation command:
    ```shell
    bazel run //transpiler/examples/string_cap_char:string_cap_char_tfhe_testbench "do or do not; there is no try"
    ```
    *  Multi-core interpreter command:
    ```shell
    bazel run //transpiler/examples/string_cap_char:string_cap_char_interpreted_tfhe_testbench "do or do not; there is no try"
    ```

![String capitalization screenshot](./images/screenshot_string_cap.png)

### Rock paper scissors

This demo allows to you to play
[rock paper scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) with
the server. The input of the players is provided and the server will evaluate
the outcome of the game, without discovering the input or the outcome.


*  Baseline FHE-C++ translation command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/rock_paper_scissor:rock_paper_scissor_tfhe_testbench PLAYER_A PLAYER_B
   ```

*  Multi-core interpreter command:
   ```shell
   bazel run //transpiler/examples/rock_paper_scissor:rock_paper_scissor_interpreted_tfhe_testbench PLAYER_A PLAYER_B
   ```

where `PLAYER_A` and `PLAYER_B` are the choice `R` (rock), `P` (paper), or `S`
(scissors). The server will return the winning player (i.e., either `A` or `B`)
or `=` in the case of a tie.

## Design

The FHE C++ Transpiler is designed to run sequentially through each of the
following five stages:

1.  The **XLS[cc] stage** translates a C++ function into an [XLS intermediate
    representation (IR)](https://google.github.io/xls/ir_semantics/).
2.  The **Optimizer stage**
    [optimizes the XLS IR](https://google.github.io/xls/optimizations/).
3.  The **Booleanifier stage**
    [re-writes the XLS IR](https://github.com/google/xls/blob/main/xls/tools/booleanify_main.cc)
    in terms of its operations' fundamental boolean operations (e.g., AND, OR,
    NOT).
4.  The **FHE IR Transpiler stage** translates the Booleanified XLS IR into
    FHE-C++.
5.  The **TFHE testbench stage** runs the FHE-C++ with
    [TFHE library](https://tfhe.github.io/tfhe/).

This library includes the code for the first four stages, but users of this
library will need to write their own C++ code to be transpiled, as well as the
TFHE testbench for the fifth stage. The included examples have testbenches that
illustrate how new testbenches can be structured.

Below are more details about each of the listed stages.

### XLS[cc] stage

This stage converts a C++ program into an [XLS intermediate representation (IR)](https://google.github.io/xls/ir_semantics/).

### Optimizer stage

In this stage, the XLS IR produced in the previous stage is optimized. For more
information, see the [XLS Optimizer documentation](https://google.github.io/xls/optimizations/).

### Booleanifier stage

Two things of note occur during this stage. First, the optimized XLS IR is
re-written in terms of its operations' fundamental Boolean operations (e.g.,
AND, OR, NOT). Next, all operations are modified to be carried out on
individual bits (since [TFHE](https://tfhe.github.io/tfhe/) encrypts data one
bit at a time).

This produces a Booleanified graph representing the operations
to perform. See the illustration below for an example.

For more information, see the [XLS Booleanifier code](https://github.com/google/xls/blob/main/xls/tools/booleanify_main.cc).

![Illustration of Booleanified graph](./images/FHE-IR.png)

### FHE IR Translation stage

The library includes two options for this stage:

1.  By default, the FHE IR Transpiler parses the Booleanified graph and
    traverses it in topological-sort order.

2.  Alternatively, the FHE IR Interpreter does the same as the aforementioned
    FHE IR Transpiler, but also provides more flexibility in execution
    strategies, including multicore dispatch for improved performance. This
    should be especially useful for heterogeneous compute environments, such as
    mixed CPU/GPU execution. Once the interpreter has been more robustly tested,
    it will eventually replace the aforementioned FHE IR Transpiler.

Ultimately, both options output C++ code that operates on encrypted input.

### TFHE testbench stage

Users of the library must write their own TFHE testbench for this stage.

The examples included in this library have testbenches that simulate a
client-server interaction as described and illustrated below.

1.  The client encodes the input data into individual bits.
2.  The client encrypts the input bits into `LWESample`s. Each
    `LWESample` represents one bit of data.
3.  The client sends the `LWESample`s to the server.
4.  The server transforms the `LWESample`s with its TFHE C++ function. This
    function was constructed by the preceding four stages described above.
5.  The server sends the transformed `LWESample`s to the client.
6.  The client decrypts the transformed `LWESample`s into the transformed
    bits of data.
7.  The client decodes the transformed bits of data into the transformed output
    data.

![Illustration of FHE client-server data processing and interaction](./images/FHE-testbench.png)

While this library does not include a working example of the client and server
deployed on separate machines, it should be possible to implement and use this
library for performing FHE C++ operations over a network.

## Security

This section explains the FTE C++ Transpiler's threat model and the estimated
bits of security provided by the library's choice of [TFHE parameters](https://tfhe.github.io/tfhe/security_and_params.html).

### Threat model

The FTE C++ Transpiler is built with honest-but-curious-server threat model in
mind.

TFHE guarantees that, without the decryption key, the only information that a
collection of FHE ciphertexts (i.e., `LweSample*`) reveals about the
encrypted plaintexts is the data type when used correctly. The computed function
(i.e., transform) is assumed to be known by both server and client.

### Bits of security

Given the parameters this library uses for [TFHE](https://tfhe.github.io/tfhe),
we currently estimate (using the
[TFHE estimator](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe#estimator-code)) that the FHE C++
Transpiler provides between 97 and 127 bits of security based on
[this running-time estimator for solving LWE instances](https://bitbucket.org/malb/lwe-estimator/src/master/).

To ensure secure usage of the FHE C++ Transpiler, we recommend following the
guidance given in the
[TFHE security estimates and parameter choices documentation](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe#security-estimates-and-parameter-choices). Should you wish to modify the TFHE parameters and
estimate the resulting bits of security, be aware that the estimators might not
be completely up to date, so proceed with caution.

## Limitations

This section describes known limitations of the FHE C++ Transpiler.

Due to the transpiler's dependency on
[XLS[cc]](https://github.com/google/xls/tree/main/xls/contrib/xlscc), they share
the following limitations:

*  Variable-length arrays are not supported, since there is no way to inspect
   the contents of the variable before trying to access it (which is the main
   benefit of FHE). One workaround is to use arrays with the largest number of
   values that may be needed. This also protects privacy since array sizes will
   not be leaked.
*  While-loops and for-loops with a variable end-condition are not supported.
   This is because FHE evaluates all code branches, which requires knowing the
   number of loop iterations beforehand. See
   [this XLS feature request](https://github.com/google/xls/issues/387) for
   updates. One workaround is to set the for-loop to terminate after the most
   expected number of iterations and add an if-statement that will cause the
   for-loop break once the index reaches the variable length instead. This is
   illustrated in the following code:
*  Floating-point data types are not supported.

```cpp
#pragma hls_top
int some_func(int image[8], int length) {
  int sum = 0;

  #pragma hls_unroll yes
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) { // "length" would not be visible on this line
    sum += image[i];
	  if(i == (length-1))
	    break;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

## Future work

In the near future, we intend to add additional optimizations to the interpreter
in the FHE IR Translation stage that will be especially useful for heterogeneous
compute environments, such as mixed CPU/GPU execution.

## Troubleshooting

Here are possible solutions to known issues with the FHE C++ Transpiler. If you
encounter an issue that is not addressed here, please file an issue on GitHub
describing the problem in as much detail as possible.

### Bazel requires `python` binary when both already installed

If Bazel requires a `python` binary present, but the `python2` and `python3`
binaries are already installed<sup>[1](#python2-and-python3)</sup>, this can be
fixed by creating a symlink to from `python` to `python2` with the following
command:

```shell
ln -s /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python
```

### Bazel reports "Unknown LLVM Release"

If Bazel reports an error about an unknown LLVM release, try replacing the
`llvm_version` in the [`WORKSPACE`](../WORKSPACE) file from `10.0.0` to
`10.0.1`.

## Endnotes

<a name="python2-and-python3">1</a>: Both `python2` and `python3` are required
for this library because it uses the [LLVM](https://www.llvm.org/) toolchain
(which requires `python2`) and [XLS](https://google.github.io/xls) (which
requires `python3`).
